        <div class="about-me-text">
            <p>I first discovered yoga while working as a solicitor and it quickly became my go-to for unwinding after a busy day,
                helping me clear my mind and reconnect with my body. Over time, I realised yoga was giving me so much more
                than just a good stretch. It was creating space to slow down, breathe, and feel more balanced in a fast-paced
                world.</p>

            <p>I've been practising for over ten years now, and I fell in love with its ability to calm the mind and nourish the
                body. Wanting to share that with others, I trained as a yoga teacher with the British Wheel of Yoga.</p>

            <p>I truly believe yoga is for everyoneâ€”no matter your age, experience, or flexibility.</p>
