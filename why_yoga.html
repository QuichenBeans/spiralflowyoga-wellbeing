            <h2>Why Practice Yoga?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Yoga is a gentle yet powerful way to care for your whole self. Some of the many benefits include:</p>
        <ul class="why-yoga-list">
            <li>More flexibility and strength</li>
            <li>Better posture and body awareness</li>
            <li>Reduced stress and anxiety</li>
            <li>Deeper breathing and better sleep</li>
            <li>Improved focus, mood, and emotional balance</li>
            <li>A stronger connection to yourself</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you're looking to feel calmer, move more freely, or simply take a pause in your day, yoga offers
            something valuable for everyone.</p>

            <h3>What to Expect in Class</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="expect2">
            <p>My classes are warm, welcoming spaces where everyone is made to feel at ease—no matter your experience,
                age, or level of flexibility.</p>
            <p>Each class begins with grounding breathwork (pranayama) and gentle movement to awaken the body. We then
                move through a mindful flow of postures (asanas), ending with a soothing, restorative relaxation (savasana).</p>
            <p>We build strength and improve flexibility while using the breath to connect mind and body, creating moments of
                stillness and calm. The goal is to help you feel more balanced, grounded, and present—both on and off the mat.</p>
            <p>I offer plenty of options and encourage you to listen to your body. You are your best guide.</p>
